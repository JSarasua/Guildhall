Jonathan Sarasua: Assignment 4
Due Date 11/16

githb repo: https://github.com/JSarasua/Guildhall/tree/master/BulletHellDungeon_Networked

I networked BulletHellDungeon_Networked which is my DFS from the summer


How to play:
1. Launch game
2. Hit Play
3. Hit ~ to open console
4. Type StartMultiplayerServer and hit enter
	You can add arguments after like StartMultiplayerServer port=48000
	Copy and Pase does work
5. Repeat 1-3 on a different game
6. Type ConnectToMultiplayerServer and hit enter

Issues
I've capped number of players to 4.
There is sometimes weird behavior with the third player.
I didn't network the weapon positions on character or animation timing
Enemies only spawn off of the last player and only target them
